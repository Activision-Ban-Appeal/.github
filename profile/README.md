<h3>👋 Welcome to Activision Ban Appeal Guide</h3>
<p>If your Activision ban appeal was denied and you can't access your favorite Activision games, we're here to help.<br>
Our dedicated team develops advanced tools to <strong>spoof your hardware ID (HWID)</strong>, allowing you to bypass hardware bans in Activision games effortlessly. Games include Call of Duty: Warzone, Modern Warfare, Vanguard, and more. Our tools are open-source, community-supported, and updated regularly to ensure your return to gameplay safely and undetected.</p>

<h3>🔍 Understanding Activision Bans</h3>
<p>Activision employs <a href="https://github.com/How-to-bypass-HWID-Hardware-ban" target="_blank">HWID bans</a>, especially via their RICOCHET anti-cheat, to prevent banned users from simply creating new accounts. Once banned, your hardware becomes flagged, making appeals often ineffective. Our HWID Spoofer masks your computer’s unique hardware identifiers, providing you with a fresh start and bypassing Activision's stringent detection.</p>
